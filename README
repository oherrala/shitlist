Data is divided into three files according to IANA IPv6
Special-Purpose Address Registry

https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml

 * ipv6-not-valid-source.txt (IANA Source column is False)

   Address from the allocated special-purpose address block is _not_
   valid when used as the source address of an IP datagram that
   transits two devices.

 * ipv6-not-valid-destination.txt (IANA Destination column is False)

   Address from the allocated special-purpose address block is _not_
   valid when used as the destination address of an IP datagram that
   transits two devices.

 * ipv6-not-forwardable.txt (IANA Forwardable or Global column is False)

   A router may _not_ forward an IP datagram whose destination address
   is drawn from the allocated special-purpose address block between
   external interfaces.

   IP datagram whose destination address is drawn from the allocated
   special-purpose address block is _not_ forwardable beyond a
   specified administrative domain.


Example for OpenBSD's pf:

  # mkdir /etc/pf.d
  # cd /etc/pf.d/
  # git clone https://github.com/oherrala/shitlist

  Then example rules into /etc/pf.conf:

    table <ipv4-not-forwardable>       persist file "/etc/pf.d/shitlist/ipv4/ipv4-not-forwardable.txt"
    table <ipv4-not-valid-destination> persist file "/etc/pf.d/shitlist/ipv4/ipv4-not-valid-destination.txt"
    table <ipv4-not-valid-source>      persist file "/etc/pf.d/shitlist/ipv4/ipv4-not-valid-source.txt"
    table <ipv6-not-forwardable>       persist file "/etc/pf.d/shitlist/ipv6/ipv6-not-forwardable.txt"
    table <ipv6-not-valid-destination> persist file "/etc/pf.d/shitlist/ipv6/ipv6-not-valid-destination.txt"
    table <ipv6-not-valid-source>      persist file "/etc/pf.d/shitlist/ipv6/ipv6-not-valid-source.txt"
